# Smart-door-unlock-using-Face-Recognition
A Smart Door that uses Face Recognition to give access to the authorized users. It uses a Raspberry Pi for handling motors and cameras, controlled by a python script and uses the Microsoft Face API for face recognition.

Objective:
The aim of this project is to present a basis of how to implement a system using facialrecognition and IoT. It will provide a way for anyone to implement a solution with low-budget hardware. The system can work on both modes online and offline. In online mode, the system can use the internet at its working time. In offline mode, the system does not use any internet connection. This project adds mainly four features: security,safety, control and monitoring to home automation.Firstly the system needs a face authentication for the user to be able to enter the home(locked/unlocked). When an unauthenticated user tries to log in, this face will be capturedand would be sent to gmail as an attachment. The system should also support remote home control.
